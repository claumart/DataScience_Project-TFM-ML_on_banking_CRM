# Financial Product Analysis Based on CRM

## Introduction
This project is a master’s thesis, here you can find the resources used to write the practical section of the thesis. 
The main purpose of this work is to apply Machine Learning Techniques to predict customer behavior and implement the proper marketing 
strategies and customer engagement campaigns based on those predictions.

## Dataset Description
The data used in this analysis were pulled from the Data Warehouse of Atlántida Bank, a prestigious Financial Company in Honduras. Specifically, 
I used data from the CRM system to differentiate customers based on their demographic and social characteristics, 
this information is complemented with the transactional behavior, and with the acquired financial products by each client.

## Implemented Technologies
In this project, I use Python as the programming language for making the data analyses and training the ML models, 
the python code runs on Jupyter Notebooks environment, and some of the most famous libraries for data analysis 
and ML in Python are used like Scikit-learn, Matplotlib Pandas

## Implemented Methodologies
The main methodologies and techniques used to segment customers and train the Machine Learning models were the following:

1. **KDD:**  _( Knowledge Discovery in Databases)_ is the process of discovering valuable information within the databases, which implies cleaning and
transforming the data and identifying the best variables to use in data analysis and Machine Learning.
This is an iterative process that requires many iterations to obtain feasible results as you make adjustments in each iteration.
This process is one of the most important methodologies in Data Mining.

2. **RFM Segmentation:** RFM stands for _recency, frequency, and monetary_, This is a methodology where we segment customers based on their
interactions with the target market, how recently they occurred, the frequency of transactions, and their monetary value.

3. **Supervised Learning Algorithms:** More specifically classification techniques such as CART, Random Forest, K-Neighbors and Logistic Regression.
   
4. **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:** More specifically clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN, KMeans, and Gaussian Mixture.
